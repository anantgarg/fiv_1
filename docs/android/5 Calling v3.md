Calling is a core feature of CometChat.

## Prerequisites

1. CometChat Core SDK installed.
2. Performed the steps mentioned in the [Setup](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v3/android-chat-sdk/setup) guide

CometChat allows two mechanisms for calling

1. **Direct Calling**
2. **Default Calling**

## Direct Calling

Direct Calling allows you to start the call/conference sessions directly with the session Id of your choice. All the users joining the same session Id are connected to the same call/conference.
For more information on Direct Calling, please visit the [Direct Calling docs](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v3/android-chat-sdk/calling-direct-calling).

## Default Calling

The second approach that CometChat allows is to implement the entire calling flow where one user initiates a call/conference and other user/users who want to be a part of the call accept/reject the call. All the users that accept the call are connected to the same session.
