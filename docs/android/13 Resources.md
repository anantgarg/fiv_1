We have a number of resources that will help you while integrating CometChat in your app.

You can begin with the [all real-time listeners](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v3/android-chat-sdk/resources-all-real-time-listeners) guide.

If you're upgrading from v1, we recommend reading our [upgrading from v1](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v3/android-chat-sdk/resources-upgrading-from-v2) guide.
