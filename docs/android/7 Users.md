The primary aim for our users' functionality is to allow you to quickly retrieve and add users to CometChat.

You can begin with [user management](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v3/android-chat-sdk/users-user-management) to sync your users to CometChat. Once that is done, you can [retrieve users](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v3/android-chat-sdk/users-retrieve-users) and display them in your app.
