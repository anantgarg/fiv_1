With language localization, our UI Kit adapts to the language of a specific country or region.  `CometChatLocalize` allows you to detect the language of your users based on their browser or device settings and set the language accordingly.

Currently, we support  12 languages for localization, they are as follows:

- **English (en, en-US, en-GB)**
- **Chinese (zh, zh-TW)**
- **Spanish (es)**
- **Hindi (hi)**
- **Russian (ru)**
- **Arabic (ar)**
- **Portuguese (pt)**
- **Malay (ms)**
- **French (fr)**
- **German (de)**
- **Swedish (sv)**
- **Lithuanian (lt)**
