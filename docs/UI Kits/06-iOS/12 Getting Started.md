- `CometChat SDK` manages chat data while communicating with `Rest API Server`. It sends an events to the UI Kit whenever there is updates on to the data.
- `CometChat UIKit` triggers `CometChat`SDK  interfaces when the user interaction has occurred or other circumstances.
- When `CometChat SDK`  sends events to UIKit, UIKit components updates views with received updated data through events.
